# Business-Case-Project - Walmart Sales and the Economy

In this project, an Indiana state official has asked some questions about business across the state. 
The offical has some specific questions about how chain retailors are effected by the wider economy, as well as a desire for some general data exploration and analysis.

# Procedure

1) Find a usable dataset for this project
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales

2) Clean the dataset to be easily browsable & import to R for analysis

3) Answer many proposed questions and do some general analysis
     Questions include:
     Which stores have the highest and lowest weekly sales?
     What factors are likely impacting the weekly sales?
     Which stores in the dataset have the lowest and highest unemployment rate?
     What factors do you think are impacting the unemployment rate?
     Is there any correlation between CPI and Weekly Sales?
     How does the correlation differ when the Holiday Flag is 0 versus when the Holiday Flag is 1?
     Why do you think Fuel Price is included in this dataset?

   To answer these questions, I utilized several data analytics techniques in R
   My code is all in the "Programming" file

4) Summarize the more technical details into a digestable, clean presentation for the official
    This presentation is located in the "Presentation for Indiana Official" file.
